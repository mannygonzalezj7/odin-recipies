    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash your hands with soap and water</li>
        <li>Cut the stem of every flower and wash delicately with cold water. Place the flowers on a 
            towel to dry the excess water. Pick the petals off or cut the flower in pieces.</li>
        <li>Pre-heat oil in a small pan on medium heat. Add the onion and salt. Stir and cook for 
            approximately 3 minutes. Add garlic and pepper, if desired. Mix and cook for 2 or 3 minutes. 
            Add the flowers and stir delicately until they wither, approximately 1 to 2 minutes. Remove 
            from the heat and mix in epazote if desired.
        </li>
        <li>Pre-heat a skillet at medium heat. Place a tortilla in the skillet and heat up both sides for approximately 
            30 seconds, or until there is air pockets in the tortillas.
        </li>
        <li>Crumble 2 tablespoons of cheese on half a tortilla. Add 2 tablespoons of the flower into 
            the mix.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use a spatula to fold the empty side over the flower side. Press softly with the spatula. 
            Cook until the cheese has melted and the tortilla starts to get crispy. Flip on the other side 
            so it gets crispy if you want. Take off the heat and continue making the rest of the quesadillas.
        </li>
        <li>To serve, cut each quesadilla in half ot inn triangles and serve with minced cilantro and salsa, 
            if desired, or add other options that you would like. Enjoy!
