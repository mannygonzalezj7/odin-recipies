        <p>Mexican red pozole is a rich broth with corn, mild pork, 
            and a flavorful sauce made with pasilla ancho chile and 
            guajillo chile. Customize each dish with add-ins like sliced radishes, 
            fresh cilantro, chopped onion, and lime.</p>

        <li>1/2 teaspoon of black ground pepper</li>
        <li>3 cans of hominy for pozole (maiz pozolero), drained and rinsed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the Salsa de Chile</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Pasilla Ancho Chili Pods, stemmed and seeded</li>
        <li>2 Guajillo Whole Chili Pods, stemmed and seeded</li>
        <li>1 cup of boiling water</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of water</li>
        <li>1 white onion, peeled and cut into fourths</li>
        <li>3 cloves of fresh garlic</li>
        <li>2 whole cloves</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon of cumin, ground</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon of salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>For the Pozole, place the pork and broth in a 5-quart pot. Bring to a boil over 
            high heat, skimming to remove any foam from the surface. Add the bay leaves, 
            oregano, cilantro, salt and pepper. Reduce heat to medium-low; and cover 
            the pot. Cook over low heat for 1 and a half hours or until the meat is tender.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, for the sauce, place the chiles in a large heatproof bowl. 
            Add boiling water; and then cover it. Soak the chiles for 30 minutes or until they soften. 
            Remove the chiles with tongs or a slotted spoon and transfer them to the blender container, 
            discarding the liquid from them. Add remaining 1/2 cup water, onion, garlic, cloves, cumin, 
            and salt; and cover the blender. Blend on high speed until well blended. Reserve.</li>
        <li>Transfer the pork to a large bowl, reserving the cooking liquid in the pot. 
            Cut the pork into large pieces with 2 forks. Return the pork to the pot. 
            Add the hominy and the prepared chili sauce; and put to boil. 
            Reduce heat to medium-low; cook over low heat for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve the pozole in deep plates. Add sliced radishes, fresh cilantro, 
            chopped onion, and lemon, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
